A extremely beta and wip and just completely broken scug that can do things when it has stuff in it's stomach
I also still need to add it's actual stats

Left Shift to use main ability
Left Control to use secondary ability
Left Alt to use tertiary ability
(not compatible with controllers and doesn't have input config yet)
(I do the controller compatibility sooner than the config)

ability's are: 
Singularity Bomb: 
main: flight up
secondary: slow flight up
tertiary + a/d/s: slow flight in direction

grenade: 
main: badly made saint ascension-like thing/BABY YOUE'RE A FIREWORK
(not working) secondary: self-destruct
tertiary: n/a

(not implemeted) Bubbleweed: longer air capacity
